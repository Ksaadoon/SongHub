# SongHub

Project #3 SEIR Immersive 2023.

SongHub was written using a Python, Django, PostGres stack.
The original idea for this application was to provide a list of artists with their respective albums and the songs with each one.
The home page lists a music catalog that is created progressively by any registered user within the app.
Only registered users can edit the music catalog.

Each registred user can select among the music catalog, the songs they want to add as favorite to their personal account.
A song can be favorited by many users, and many users can favorite the same song.

The application is deployed on Heroku.
