# SongHub

Project #3 SEIR Immersive 2023.

The context of the app is to have a relationship between user, song, album and artist. The user will also be able to add "favorite" songs to their own playlist/favorite songs list.
Optional feature: Depending on delivery time, the user will also be able to add a picture of the artist or album.
So far, I have used DJANGO, PSQL and Python. This app will contain more features like HTML and CSS.
Lastly, the server will be deployed on Heroku at the end of the project.
